I'm a third year student at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), where I study both computer science and statistics.  I hope to use my knowledge in these subjects to pursue projects related to data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.  I am always seeking data-driven answers to challenging questions.

Computer Science Coursework
------

At UIUC, I've taken courses in the following:

+ __CS 225 - Data structures -__ data abstractions, implementation in C++, computation on graphs and trees, elementary algorithm analysis.
+ __CS 241 - System Programming -__ POSIX processes, process control, inter-process communication, synchronization, signals, memory management, shell programming
+ __CS 242 - Programming Studio -__ intensive object-oriented programming lab, mobile development.
+ __CS 357 - Numerical Methods -__ floating-point computation, approximation of functions, numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations.
+ __CS 374 - Algorithms & Models of Computation -__ Analysis of algorithms, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, formal models of computation including finite + automata and Turing machines, reductions, undecidability and NP-completeness.
+ __CS 412 - Introduction to Data Mining -__ Data warehousing and data mining, design and implementation of data warehouse and on-line analytical processing.
+ __CS 421 - Programming Languages & Compilers -__ Structure and implementation of programming languages. functional languages; type systems; object-oriented languages.  lexing, parsing, syntax-directed translation, semantic analysis, and code generation.

Statistics Coursework
------

+ __STAT 400 - Statistics and Probability I -__ calculus of probability, random variables, expectation, distribution functions, central limit theorem, point + estimation, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.
+ __STAT 410 - Statistics and Probability II -__ moment-generating functions, transformations of random variables, normal sampling theory, sufficiency, best estimators, maximum likelihood + estimators, confidence intervals, most powerful tests, unbiased tests, and chi-square tests.
+ __STAT 420 - Methods of Applied Statistics -__ calculus-based coverage of simple and multiple regression, correlation, analysis of variance and covariance, + multiple comparisons, goodness of fit tests, contingency tables, nonparametric procedures, and power of tests.
+ __STAT 428 - Statistical Computing -__ R programming course for numerical analysis, Monte Carlo methods, linear and nonlinear models.


More About Me
